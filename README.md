# mp4box
Python 3 port of the MP4Box tool. It is supposed to be a library for those who want to work with MP4 files:
* fetching metadata, iterating over frames (almost done)
* segmentation and fragmentation (to be started)
* track extraction (to be started)

# why?
I came across this [JS version of MP4Box](https://github.com/gpac/mp4box.js) and thought why not a Python version!

# long term goals
* Learn Python.
* I want this to be a part of the [gpac](https://github.com/gpac) umbrella.

# contributions
* I expect a test-case to be written for all the classes/methods/free-functions added.
* No/minimal dependencies on third-party stuff.
* Use Python 3 idioms wherever applicable.
